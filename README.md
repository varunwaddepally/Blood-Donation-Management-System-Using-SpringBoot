# Blood-Donation-Management-System-Using-SpringBoot
**Description:**

Developed a robust, full-stack web application using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL to streamline blood donation workflows and enhance the donor search experience. The application enables secure user authentication, donor registration (for self or others), and dynamic search functionality by blood group or geographic location. Integrated JavaMailSender for real-time email notifications to donors upon request submission.

**Key features include:**

User and donor registration with secure login.

Duplicate email validation:
Implemented backend logic to check for existing email addresses during data insertion, ensuring database integrity and delivering informative error messages on the UI.

RESTful API development for modular, scalable communication between frontend and backend.

Exception handling and validation mechanisms to enhance user experience and prevent runtime failures.

This project showcases advanced proficiency in the Spring ecosystem, including dependency injection, persistence management, and REST API development. It reflects strong backend development skills and the ability to build real-world healthcare-oriented solutions with a focus on data accuracy, usability, and maintainability.

Technologies Used: Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, MySQL, JavaMailSender, Thymeleaf, REST APIs.
